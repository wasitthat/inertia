Inertia 
What The Fuck


Lyrics by Vincent Fernandez
Music by Inertia

What the fuck?
What's it really worth to you and why did you do this to me, it's all so wrong.

And what the fuck?
What did you really wanna prove and why did I let this go on for so long?

And here I go again
Just blaming you for me.

What the fuck?
What do you really want me to do you need to think again cause you're just
fucking with me

What the fuck?
Why is it so hard to chose? I should have known you weren't the one for me.

And here I go again
Just blaming you for me.

And here I go again.
Just blaming you for me.

Me.
It's always been me.

So what's it all worth? What's it worth?
So what's it all worth? What's it worth?


And here I go again
Just blaming you for me.

And here I go again.
Just blaming you for me.

Me.
It's always been me.

It's always been me.
