Inertia
Where Were You


Lyrics by Vincent Fernandez


How did I become the target of your misery?
So much anger, frustrations being poured on me.
And where were you?
Where were you??

So now you blame me for all our mistakes and our failures.
We once shared dreams and love but now it's just pity and anger.

There's no use in lying. 
Why are you lying?

You wonder how we got here?
What the fuck did I do to deserve this?

And where were you?
Where were you?

I didn't see this coming down.
Got to admit you got me good.

I didn't feel right this time.
You don't treat me like you should.

Deep down you know that it's too late.
I'm just a target for all the hate.

Now I see that there is something here.
All these images are disturbing to me.


Really?

And now I see, myself just dying because of you.
I must be guilty.
So go off now, and find out what it's like to lose your shit.
You did this to me. 
The target for your hate.

Where were you?

And where were you?

Where were you?

You lied.

Where were you?

Where were you?

Where were you?
