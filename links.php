    <p>
        Inertia was founded in Southern California in early 2002 with Vincent Fernandez, John Oden and Arthur Rodriguez.
        Playing with reckless abandon and with a zeal for attention, Inertia quickly became the local mosh-able must-see
        metal group around, playing original bone crushing tunes such as 'Dun Dun Dun Dun' and 'Where Were You?'.
    </p>
    <p>Inertia is currently in the studio working on their long awaited full length record.</p>
